This is the file /emx/info/dir, which contains the topmost node of the
Info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Info you start off
looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree

  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.
  Typing <Ctrl-Home> returns here, <Escape> exits, <F1> lists all 
  INFO commands, "h" gives a primer for first-timers, "mcpp<Enter>" 
  visits cpp topic, etc.
  
  --- PLEASE ADD DOCUMENTATION TO THIS TREE. (See INFO topic first.) ---

* Menu: The list of major topics begins on the next line.

* info: (info.info).     Documentation browsing system.
* cpp: (cpp.info).       GNU C preprocessor.
* gcc: (gcc.info).       GNU C compiler.
* gdb: (gdb.info).       GNU debugger.
